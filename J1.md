# Question 1.) Fault Localization
Fault Localization is an alterantive saying of **debugging your code**. Fault localization often involves tracing back
to the line of the code that is causing the error. Examples of Fault Localization could be debuggers, print statements, or tracing.

# Question 2.) Test Driven Devolpment (TDD)
- TDD helps eliminate bias on our code
- Writing tests help us to start/write our code
- Writing tests help us think about the requirements in our system

# Question 3.) Input Domain partitions


# Question 4.) Truth Table
| a > b | G | x < y | predicate outcome | clause responsible |
| ----- | - | ----- | ----------------- | ------------------ |

# Question 5.) Control flow Graph

# Question 6.)
Some benefits that Mutation testing has over testing all possible paths via test cases is that 
in some while in theory test cases might work, in practice due to the praticital nature of the program/code
test cases often won't cover 100% of the bases. Instead Mutation testing, is where programmers would deliberatly
put bugs in order to check if the test case would detect the bugs.
